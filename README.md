# Community-Detection-using-Girvan-Newman-Algorithm
This project implements an edge-removal community detection algorithm based on edge betweenness centrality (inspired by the Girvan-Newman Algorithm) on a subsampled Flickr graph using igraph, iteratively removing high-betweenness edges to detect and visualize social communities.
